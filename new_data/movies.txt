He Thinks of Sunder as below

Sunder is the kind of guy who treats doing nothing like it’s a full-time job. He thinks traveling is just an overpriced way to get tired, and firmly believes that money is best enjoyed after retirement—preferably with a walking stick and blood pressure pills. While the world debates current affairs, Sunder proudly lives under a rock, blissfully unaware of anything that doesn’t involve discounts or fixed deposits. He’s the human version of “I’ll deal with it later,” and somehow, he wears it like a badge of honor. But hey, give him a spreadsheet and a dream of pension life, and he’s perfectly content.
